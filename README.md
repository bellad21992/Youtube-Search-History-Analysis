# Youtube-Search-History-Analysis

This is an exploration and analysis of my Youtube Search History from 2012-2023. Explores the number of searches per year, month, week, day, and hour. The most searches were in 2016, and searches tended to occur more on weekends and nighttimes. Sorted data into categories: Music, Entertainment, Educational, Ice Skating, Crafts, Beauty, and Other. Explores time trends for each category as well as most frequently searched-for words in each category.
